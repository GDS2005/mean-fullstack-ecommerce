# MeanEcommerce

Ecommerce made with the MEAN stack. Angular 17.2.0 works as Client side framework (Frontend) and MongoDB, Express and Node.js as a Server side API REST (Backend).

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js Installed
2. MongoDB Connection
3. In Windows; `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` to execute commands in console.

## First Steps

1. Clone the respository `git clone https://github.com/GDS2005/mean-fullstack-ecommerce.git`.
2. Install Node Modules: `npm install`.
3. Install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Also, run `node .\server\server.js` for the API REST.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
